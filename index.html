                                  I received by B.S. in Astrophysics and a minor in English from Tufts University in 2018.
                                  I applied to 15 Ph.D. programs as a senior undergraduate student and was not admitted to any.
                                  Instead, I joined the one-year Masters Program in Physical Sciences program at the University of Chicago.
                                  I graduated with my M.S. in 2019 before joining the Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago in the
                                  Department in Astronomy and Astrophysics. I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis in March, 2023. From
                                  2023 - 2024, I was a NASA Sagan Postdoctoral Fellow at the
                                  <a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics</a>
                                  at the University of Colorado Boulder. Thanks to the flexibility of the NASA Sagan Fellowship, I
                                  was able to move my second year of funding to my current institution: Michigan State University.

                          <p>I am an observational astronomer. My research focuses on understanding

                             and how stellar activity will shape the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres.
                             I use a variety of techniques to approach answering scientific questions
                             relating to this field. My research highlights the power of conducting
                             multi-wavelength campaigns using ground- and space-based observations
                             from the X-ray through the infrared to shed light on how stars and
                             exoplanets evolve.

                            While planets with radii between Earth and Neptune are ubiquitous, we
                          do not have a direct analog in our own Solar System. This type of exoplanet
                          is often referred to as a "sub-Neptune." One way in which we try to understand
                          what these planets are like is by studying their atmospheres via transmission
                          spectroscopy. To do this, we observe a transit at multiple wavelengths to look for
                          absorption from specific molecular species which may be present in the atmosphere.
                          Atmospheric observations of <i>mature</i> sub-Neptunes (t<sub>age</sub> > 1 Gyr)
                          have revealed statistically featureless transmission spectra, meaning we cannot
                          directly detect any atmospheric species. However <i>young</i> sub-Neptunes
                          (t<sub>age</sub> < 300 Myr), which have inflated radii compared to their mature
                          counterparts, may be more favorable targets for disentangling their atmospheric
                          compositions. I am the <b>PI of 251 hours of JWST time</b> (GO 5311, 5959, 8597) which will study the atmospheric
                          composition of nine young sub-Neptunes using a combination of NIRISS/SOSS, NIRCam/F322W2/F444W,
                          and NIRSpec/G395H. Through these programs, I aim to answer questions about (i) the compostion
                          of sub-Neptune atmospheres; (ii) how the atmospheric properties may evolve in time; and (iii) how
                          homoegeneity of sub-Neptune atmospheric compositions within the same and differing systems.

                          Young stars are known to have heightened magnetic activity compared to main sequence stars.
                          This activity can manifest in a variety of ways, such as having more starspots on the stellar surface
                          or exhibiting higher rates of stellar flares and coronal mass ejections. We can study
                          these events very well on the Sun, and see how the occurrence rate and strength of stellar flares
                          changes throughout the solar cycle. However, it is harder to understand the mechanisms driving
                          stellar flares on other stars since they cannot be resolved. My research focuses on using a combination
                          of photometry and spectroscopy to understand flare statistics across thousands of stars and
                          determine accurate parameters (e.g., energies, velocities, temperatures) of flares. Through this
                          multi-prong approach, I am to provide a wholistic view of flare physics on stars other than the Sun.

                                  Applying to graduate school can be challenging to navigate. I seek to make this process
                                  more transparent and equitable to undergraduate students who wish to pursue a Ph.D.
                                  in astronomy/astrophysics. Our

                                  hosts a number of great questions to answer when applying to our program, as well as other

                      <p>
                        I am a strong advocate for open and reproducible science.
                        One way in which I support this is by making all code I develop
                        for any research project publicly available on
                        <a href="https://github.com/afeinstein20" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
                        For code that may be of particular interest or use to the community, I
                        bundle it up into a neat little pip installable Python package.
                        Below are the summaries of my current pip installable packages.
                      </p>

                        eleanor is a Python package used to extract systematic-corrected light curves
                        from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
                        Full-Frame Images (FFIs). In its simplest form, eleanor takes a
                        TESS Input Catalog (TIC) ID, a Gaia source ID, or Ra, Dec coordinates of a star
                        and returns, as a single object, and light curve and accompanying target pixel
                        data. eleanor is highly flexible and customizable, allowing it to be used to
                        study exoplanet astronomy, stellar astrophysics, and galactic/extragalactic
                        astronomy. The full documentation for eleanor can be found

                      </pre>

                      The purpose of stella is to identify flares in TESS short-cadence data with
                      a convolutional neural network (CNN). In its simplest form, stella takes a
                      pre-trained CNN (details provided in Feinstein et al. (submitted)) and a
                      light curve (time, flux, and flux error) and returns a probability light
                      curve. The cadences in the probability light curve are values between 0 and
                      1, where 1 means the CNN finds a flare there. Users also have the ability
                      the train their own customized CNN architecture. The full documentation for stella can be

                                  <p>
                                    3I/ATLAS is the third macroscopic interstellar object detected traversing the Solar System.
                                    Since its initial discovery on UT 01 July 2025, hundreds of hours on a range of observational
                                    facilities have been dedicated to measure the physical properties of this object. These
                                    observations have provided astrometry to refine the orbital solution, photometry to measure
                                    the color, a rotation period and secular light curve, and spectroscopy to characterize the
                                    composition of the coma. Here, we report precovery photometry of 3I/ATLAS as observed with
                                    NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 3I/ATLAS was observed nearly continuously
                                    by TESS from UT 07 May 2025 to 02 June 2025. We use the shift-stack method to create deep
                                    stack images to recover the object. These composite images reveal that 3I/ATLAS has an average
                                    TESS magnitude of Tmag=19.6±0.1 and an absolute visual magnitude of HV=12.5±0.3, consistent
                                    with magnitudes reported in July 2025, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS may have been active out at
                                    ∼6.4 au. Additionally, we extract a ∼20 day light curve and find no statistically significant
                                    evidence of a nucleus rotation period. Nevertheless, the data presented here are some of the
                                    earliest precovery images of 3I/ATLAS and may be used in conjunction with future observations

                                  GKM Stars Younger Than 300 Myr over Five Years of TESS Observations</h4>
                                <p>
                                  Stellar flares are short-duration (< hours) bursts of radiation associated with surface
                                  magnetic reconnection events. Stellar magnetic activity generally decreases as a function
                                  of both the age and Rossby number, R0, a measure of the relative importance of the
                                  convective and rotational dynamos. Young stars (< 300 Myr) have typically been overlooked
                                  in population-level flare studies due to challenges with flare-detection methods. Here,
                                  we select a sample of stars that are members of 26 nearby moving groups, clusters, or
                                  associations with ages < 300 Myr that have been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
                                  Satellite at 2 minute cadence. We identified 26,355 flares originating from 3160 stars
                                  and robustly measured the rotation periods of 1847 stars. We measure and find the flare
                                  frequency distribution slope, α, saturates for all spectral types at α ∼ −0.5 and is
                                  constant over 300 Myr. Additionally, we find that flare rates for stars tage = 50–250 Myr
                                  are saturated below R0 < 0.14, which is consistent with other indicators of magnetic
                                  activity. We find evidence of annual flare rate variability in eleven stars, potentially
                                  correlated with long-term stellar activity cycles. Additionally, we crossmatch our entire
                                  sample with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and find no correlation between flare rate and
                                  far- and near-ultraviolet flux. Finally, we find the flare rates of planet-hosting stars
                                  are relatively lower than comparable, larger samples of stars, which may have ramifications
                                  for the atmospheric evolution of short-period exoplanets.

                                  Photoevaporation is believed to dominate the removal of planetary
                                  atmospheres when they are young (< 100 Myr). Signatures of atmospheric
                                  mass-loss can be observed in the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-infrared.
                                  We present Far-UV transit observations of AU Mic b (∼22 Myr) and V1298 Tau c (∼28 Myr)
                                  with the Hubble Space Telescope. We search for evidence of

                                  their behavior to tracers of stellar activity. We detect no evidence of
                                  atmospheric mass loss, and place upper limits on the radii of AU Mic b and V1298 Tau c.

                                <p>
                                  The Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b has been the subject of extensive efforts to
                                  determine its atmospheric properties using transmission spectroscopy. However,
                                  these efforts have been hampered by modelling degeneracies between composition
                                  and cloud properties that are caused by limited data quality. Here we
                                  present the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b obtained using the Single-Object
                                  Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph
                                  (NIRISS) instrument on the JWST. This spectrum spans 0.6–2.8 μm in wavelength and
                                  shows several water-absorption bands, the potassium resonance doublet and signatures
                                  of clouds. The precision and broad wavelength coverage of NIRISS/SOSS allows us to
                                  break model degeneracies between cloud properties and the atmospheric composition of
                                  WASP-39b, favouring a heavy-element enhancement (‘metallicity’) of about 10–30 times
                                  the solar value, a sub-solar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and a solar-to-super-solar
                                  potassium-to-oxygen (K/O) ratio. The observations are also best explained by
                                  wavelength-dependent, non-grey clouds with inhomogeneous coverageof the planet’s terminator.

                                  from young stars impacts planetary atmospheric chemistry
                                  and mass loss. The active ∼22 Myr M dwarf AU Mic hosts two
                                  exoplanets orbiting interior to its debris disk. Therefore, this
                                  system provides a unique opportunity to quantify the effects of
                                  stellar X-ray and UV irradiation on planetary atmospheres as a function
                                  of both age and orbital separation. In this paper, we present over 5 hr
                                  of far-UV (FUV) observations of AU Mic taken with the Cosmic Origins
                                  Spectrograph (COS; 1070-1360 Å) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We
                                  provide an itemization of 120 emission features in the HST/COS FUV spectrum
                                  and quantify the flux contributions from formation temperatures ranging from
                                  10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> K. We detect 13 flares in the FUV
                                  white-light curve with energies ranging from 10<sup>29</sup> to
                                  10<sup>31</sup> erg s. The majority of the energy in each of these flares
                                  is released from the transition region between the chromosphere and the
                                  corona. There is a 100× increase in flux at continuum wavelengths λ < 1100 Å
                                  in each flare, which may be caused by thermal Bremsstrahlung emission. We
                                  calculate that the baseline atmospheric mass-loss rate for AU Mic b is ∼10<sup>8</sup>
                                  g s<sup>−1</sup>, although this rate can be as high as ∼10<sup>14</sup> g s−1 during flares with
                                  L<sub>flare</sub> >= 10<sup>33</sup> erg s−1. Finally, we model the transmission
                                  spectra for AU Mic b and c with a new panchromatic spectrum of AU Mic and motivate future
                                  JWST observations of these planets.

                                  across the Main Sequence Using Stellar Flares from TESS</h4>
                                <p>
                                  Self-organized criticality describes a class of dynamical systems that
                                  maintain themselves in an attractor state with no intrinsic length or
                                  timescale. Fundamentally, this theoretical construct requires a mechanism
                                  for instability that may trigger additional instabilities locally via
                                  dissipative processes. This concept has been invoked to explain nonlinear
                                  dynamical phenomena such as featureless energy spectra that have been observed
                                  empirically for earthquakes, avalanches, and solar flares. If this interpretation
                                  proves correct, it implies that the solar coronal magnetic field maintains
                                  itself in a critical state via a delicate balance between the dynamo-driven
                                  injection of magnetic energy and the release of that energy via flaring events.
                                  All-sky high-cadence surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
                                  (TESS) provide the necessary data to compare the energy distribution of flaring
                                  events in stars of different spectral types to that observed in the Sun. We
                                  identified ∼10<sup>6</sup> flaring events on ∼10<sup>5</sup> stars observed by TESS at a 2 minute cadence.
                                  By fitting the flare frequency distribution for different mass bins, we find that
                                  all main-sequence stars exhibit distributions of flaring events similar to that
                                  observed in the Sun, independent of their mass or age. This may suggest that stars
                                  universally maintain a critical state in their coronal topologies via magnetic
                                  reconnection events. If this interpretation proves correct, we may be able to infer
                                  properties of magnetic fields, interior structure, and dynamo mechanisms for stars
                                  that are otherwise unresolved point sources.

                                  During a Transit of the 23 Myr Planet V1298 Tau c</h4>
                                <p>
                                  Young transiting exoplanets (< 100 Myr) provide crucial insight into atmospheric
                                  evolution via photoevaporation. However, transmission spectroscopy measurements
                                  to determine atmospheric composition and mass loss are challenging due to the
                                  activity and prominent stellar disk inhomogeneities present on young stars. We
                                  observed a full transit of V1298 Tau c, a 23 Myr, 5.59 R⊕ planet orbiting a young
                                  K0-K1.5 solar analog with GRACES on Gemini North. We were able to measure the Doppler
                                  tomographic signal of V1298 Tau c using the Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) and find a
                                  projected obliquity of λ = 5° ± 15°. The tomographic signal is only seen in the
                                  chromospherically driven core of the Ca II IRT, which may be the result of star-planet
                                  interactions. Additionally, we find that excess absorption of the Hα line decreases
                                  smoothly during the transit. While this could be a tentative detection of hot gas
                                  escaping the planet, we find this variation is consistent with similar timescale
                                  observations of other young stars that lack transiting planets over similar
                                  timescales. We show this variation can also be explained by the presence of starspots
                                  with surrounding facular regions. More observations both in and out of the transits
                                  of V1298 Tau c are required to determine the nature of the Ca II IRT and Hα line variations.

                                  Neural Network Analysis of TESS Data</h4>
                                <p>
                                  All-sky photometric time-series missions have allowed for the monitoring of thousands of young (t<sub>age</sub> < 800 Myr)
                                  stars in order to understand the evolution of stellar activity. Here, we developed a convolutional neural network
                                  (CNN), stella, specifically trained to find flares in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) short-cadence
                                  data. We applied the network to 3200 young stars in order to evaluate flare rates as a function of age and spectral
                                  type. The CNN takes a few seconds to identify flares on a single light curve. We also measured rotation periods for
                                  1500 of our targets and find that flares of all amplitudes are present across all spot phases, suggesting high spot
                                  coverage across the entire surface. Additionally, flare rates and amplitudes decrease for stars t<sub>age</sub> > 50 Myr across
                                  all temperatures T<sub>eff</sub> ≥ 4000 K, while stars from 2300 ≤ T<sub>eff</sub> < 4000 K show no evolution across 800 Myr. Stars of
                                  T<sub>eff</sub> ≤ 4000 K also show higher flare rates and amplitudes across all ages. We investigate the effects of high
                                  flare rates on photoevaporative atmospheric mass loss for young planets. In the presence of flares, planets lose
                                  4%–7% more atmosphere over the first 1 Gyr. stella is an open-source Python toolkit hosted on

                                  Sometimes, I do things outside of the office! I
                                  enjoy crocheting, cross-stitching, hiking, baking,
                                  and hanging out with my cats. Additionally, I enjoy
                                  partaking in every cozy fall activity such as apple picking,
                                  doing corn mazes, picking and carving pumpkins, and just
                                  generally enjoying fall foliage. In the winter, I enjoy
                                  spending time at home playing what would probably be
                                  considered too much Stardew Valley.
