      In order to understand the mature exoplanet population seen today, it is important to understand the environments in which
      they grew and evolved in. In particular, young stars (< 800 Myr) are much more magnetically active compared to their main
      sequence counterparts. My most recent work evaluated flare rate as a function of stellar age using TESS 2-minute observations.
      I created and trained a convolutional neural network to identify flare events. These methods assign a probability that an event is a flare or not.
      We found that stars with effective temperatures > 4000 K show a decrease in flare rate beyond 50 Myr, while cooler stars remain
      consistently active across the first 800 Myr of their lives. We also found that planets lose 4-7% more atmosphere when accounting for flares.

    <p>
      I am the lead developer of an open-source Python package, eleanor,
      can be used to explore the TESS Full-Frame Images (FFIs). Light curves for every star in the 
      TESS Input Catalog (TIC) brighter than Tmag = 16, for which 1% photometry is achievable, will be
      hosted on MAST and newly identified exoplanet candidates will be posted on ExoFOP-TESS as
      Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs).
      Users can create custom light curves for any source in the TESS field of view (e.g. solar system objects, extragalactic sources).
