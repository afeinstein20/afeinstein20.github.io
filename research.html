      Stars produce explosive flares, which are believed to be powered by the release of energy 
      stored in coronal magnetic field configurations. It has been shown that solar flares exhibit 
      energy distributions typical of self-organized critical systems. This study applies a novel 
      flare detection technique to data obtained by NASA's TESS mission and identifies ~10^6 flaring 
      events on ~10^5 stars across spectral types. Our results suggest that magnetic reconnection 
      events that maintain the topology of the magnetic field in a self-organized critical state 
      are ubiquitous among stellar coronae.

      Young transiting exoplanets (< 100 Myr) provide crucial insight into atmospheric evolution via photoevaporation. 
      However, transmission spectroscopy measurements to determine atmospheric composition and mass loss are challenging due 
      to the activity and prominent stellar disk inhomogeneities present on young stars. We observed a full transit of 
      V1298 Tau c, a 23 Myr, 5.59R⊕ planet orbiting a young K0-K1.5 solar analogue with GRACES on Gemini-North. We were 
      able to measure the Doppler tomographic signal of V1298 Tau c using the Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) and find a 
      projected obliquity of λ=5∘±15∘. The tomographic signal is only seen in the chromospherically driven core of the 
      Ca II IRT, which may be the result of star-planet interactions. Additionally, we find that excess absorption of 
      the H-alpha line decreases smoothly during the transit. While this could be a tentative detection of hot gas 
      escaping the planet, we find this variation is consistent with similar timescale observations of other young 
      stars that lack transiting planets over similar timescales. We show this variation can also be explained by the 
      presence of starspots with surrounding facular regions. More observations both in- and out-of the transits of 
      V1298 Tau c are required to determine the nature of the Ca II IRT and H-alpha line variations.

      In order to understand the mature exoplanet population seen today, it is important to understand the environments in which
      they grew and evolved in. In particular, young stars (< 800 Myr) are much more magnetically active compared to their main
      sequence counterparts. My most recent work evaluated flare rate as a function of stellar age using TESS 2-minute observations.
      I created and trained a convolutional neural network to identify flare events. These methods assign a probability that an event is a flare or not.
      We found that stars with effective temperatures > 4000 K show a decrease in flare rate beyond 50 Myr, while cooler stars remain
      consistently active across the first 800 Myr of their lives. We also found that planets lose 4-7% more atmosphere when accounting for flares.

      I am the lead developer of an open-source Python package, eleanor,
      can be used to explore the TESS Full-Frame Images (FFIs). Light curves for every star in the 
      TESS Input Catalog (TIC) brighter than Tmag = 16, for which 1% photometry is achievable, will be
      hosted on MAST and newly identified exoplanet candidates will be posted on ExoFOP-TESS as
      Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs).
      Users can create custom light curves for any source in the TESS field of view (e.g. solar system objects, extragalactic sources).
